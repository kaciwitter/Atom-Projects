    <p>Hello! Welcome to my page. My name is Kaci Witter, and I am a Digital Innovation student at Arkansas State University. I made this page to serve as a tool for others to get to know a bit about myself and to view my work. As always, thank you for taking the time to view this page. I hope you enjoy!
        <h2>Early Years</h2>
    <img src="Images/Myfamilythen.jpg" alt="Family photo of all of us in 1995" class=center>
    <p>I was born in Mountain Home, Arkansas on August 28, 1994. My mom had always wanted a girl, but thought she was done having kids in 1985 after having three boys within a four-year period. In 1992, a few years after leaving an abusive relationship, she met my dad. Two years later, I fought my way into the world. </p>
        <p>Mom always told me that I was the easiest kid, but my memories beg to differ. For as long as I can remember, I've been pretty stubborn. When I was born, my brothers were almost teenagers, so I often felt like the only child. Because of this, and the fact that I was the only girl, I may have been a bit spoiled. Somehow, I grew up alright. </p>
       <p>I went to Cotter High School from kindergarten to high school graduation. From around 5th grade to my senior year I suffered from social anxiety. It wasn't until I got my first job that I really started to open up to people. In school, I did pretty well. I had always been an honor roll student. I never really enjoyed school per se, but I was good at it. My favorite part of school was always art class. I loved finding different ways to express myself. When I was in 11th grade, I took Desktop Publishing. This is when I first got into computer graphics. From then on, I had a passion for digital arts.
      <h2>After Highschool</h2>

      <p>The fall after graduation, I enrolled in Arkansas State University Mountain Home to get my basics taken care of. At this point, I really didn't have much of an idea of what I would do after. I got my first D in biology during the first semester. After that, I stopped caring as much. I failed two classes during my second semester. This is when I got put on Academic Probation and decided not to go back. I realized how stupid that decision was a year later. In 2015, I forced myself to go back and retake the failed classes and to finish up my degree. I graduated in December of 2016 with my Associate of Arts. I still was unsure of what I wanted to go to school for. On December 24, 2016, my dad suddenly passed away from a heart attack. This broke me in so many ways. After high school, we didn't keep in touch a whole lot except around the holidays. I had my own life and he had his, but both of us were too stubborn to spend time together. It kills me that I didn't spend more time with him. His lifestyle wasn't the greatest and I think I sort of distanced myself. After this happened, going back to college was the farthest thing from my mind. </p>
      <p> For months after my father's death, I was in a major depressive state. I had a job and I continued to work, but I just wasn't happy. I needed a change. During May of 2017, my boyfriend was talking to a friend that lived in Florida. She owned a <a href="https://workingtheflame.com/lampworking-vs-glassblowing/">lampworking</a> studio in Deland. She was joking around with him one day and mentioned us coming to live with her. Somehow, one thing led to another and we ended up moving for a bit. Things really didn't turn out as planned, but we did learn a new skill. We moved back around December of 2017.
      <p> After working a few jobs that I dreaded, I finally made the decision to go back to college. I had a hard time deciding what to major in because I didn't think I was that good at anything. I also didn't want to waste years studying something that I would end up hating. After looking at different schools and degree options, I finally decided to get my degree in Digital Innovation.</p>
      <h2> Here and Now </h2>

    <p> A special thank you to those who made it this far. I tend to write a lot.</p>
     <p> Last year, I enrolled in Arkansas State University. I'm currently on my second semester and still going strong. Let me first say that I am so happy that I went this route. I love that I can study something that truly intrigues me. So far, I have learned so much useful information. I've never felt so motivated to finish something in my life!</p>
    <p> In August, my boyfriend and I moved to Moline, Illinois. Currently, we are staying with his Grandmother, but are looking for a house to buy. I currently work at Lowe's as a Merchandising Associate. I don't have any kids, but I do have three amazing cats: Wookie, Pearl, and Sissy. </p>
      <h2>My Design Experience</h2>
 <p> Obviously, I'm still a beginner in the design world, but I've come a long way in just half a year. In my first semester, I learned a lot in many Adobe programs including Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. I have learned some about the visual designing of a website. Currently, I'm starting to learn the coding part. Below, you can find the link to a design portfolio I made last semester. It features a lot of the work I did for classes. </p>

  <p> Once again, thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I can't express my appreciation! Hopefully, one day I be able to do some work for you!</p>
